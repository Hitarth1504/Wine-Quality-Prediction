# Wine Quality Prediction System

## Project Description
This project is based on Machine Learning to predict the quality of wine using
various chemical properties such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, and density.

The model is trained using Linear Regression algorithm.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
Dataset Name: winequality.csv  
The dataset contains chemical attributes like:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

## Algorithm Used
- Linear Regression

## Features
- Data preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Accuracy evaluation using:
  - R2 Score
  - Mean Absolute Error
